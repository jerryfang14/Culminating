This study planner is designed to manage tasks, and help students organize academic requirements and projects to successfully complete their tasks. This application will allow users to create tasks, assign deadlines, and visually track progress toward completion.

I chose this project because it relates to me as a student while satisfying the requirements for several programming concepts I learnt throughout the course. 

I will demonstrate the following requirement concepts in these ways:
Inheritance: creating new tasks
File I/O: saving and loading user tasks
Class Organisation and Modular Structure: separating functions to make program easy to understand
Animation: progress bars and timers
Event Handling: button clicks and user input
JComponents: buttons, text fields, progress bars
